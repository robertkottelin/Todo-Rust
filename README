A simple but not so effective Todo command line program written in rust!
Use this to keep your life under control and gain an unfair advantage!

Add an item to the list: 
cargo run -- add "item"

Mark an item as completed: 
cargo run -- complete "item"

Open "todo.db" with SQLiteViewer to see your list.
